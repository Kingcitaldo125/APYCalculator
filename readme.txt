This python script is a calculator for growth of principal over time.
This is intended for investors that are seeking to calculate how much their initial contributions
will earn over time, regardless of individual contributions.

For example:
	P = 65000
	R = 8(percent)
	years = 10
	
	Total after 10 years = $140330

Another example:
	P = 1000
	R = 2
	years = 20
	
	Total after 20 years = $1485

Individual contributions will be included at a later date. For now, no individual contributions are
included in the calculated sums.

The future capabilities of the script should be capable of adding/factoring in contributions over time
to the grand total. Example, if you contribute 1000 per month to a principal of 5000, then that 6000 would be used as 
the new principal. After that new principal is calculated, then the rate calclation would take effect, and the new running total
would be made.

For now, this is a simple way to calculate rate of growth over time without contributions coming into play.

Thanks for using this!,
