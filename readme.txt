This python script is a calculator for growth of principal over time.
This is intended for investors that are seeking to calculate how much their money
will earn over time, regardless of individual contributions.

Q: How is this unique?
A: None of the other calculators that I have seen, thus far, factor in individual contributions over a period of time. This one will.
It will also show running totals, which I have not seen from an online calculator, from both pre and post contribution amounts.

For example:
	P = 65000
	R = 8(percent)
	C = 0
	years = 10
	
	Total after 10 years = $140330

Another example:
	P = 1000
	R = 2
	C = 1
	years = 20
	
	Total after 20 years = $1510

Individual contributions are being factored in. If you don't want to factor in contributions, no problem.
The script will calculate both pre and post contribution amounts, and show the results on the fly.

The future capabilities of the script, after April 14th 2019, are unknown at this time.

For now, this is a simple way to calculate rate of growth over time without contributions coming into play.

This hasn't been fully tested. Proceed with caution. Errors/bugs may be present.

Thanks for using this!,
